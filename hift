[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mredshift [22madjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your
       surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less or reduce the risk  for
       delayed  sleep phase syndrome if you are working in front of the screen
       at night.

       The color temperature is set according to the position of  the  sun.  A
       different  color  temperature  is  set during night and daytime. During
       twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions  smoothly
       from  night  to  daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly adapt
       over a period of about an hour. At night the color  temperature  should
       be set to match the lamps in your room. This is typically a low temper‚Äê
       ature at around 3000K-4000K (default is 4500K).  During  the  day,  the
       color temperature should match the light from outside, typically around
       5500K-6500K (default is 6500K). The light has a higher  temperature  on
       an overcast day.

       In  addition  to  the  command-line tool [1mredshift[22m, the GUI [1mredshift-gtk[0m
       provides an alternative interface that shows up as a notification  icon
       in the desktop environment.

              Color temperature to set at daytime/night.

       The  neutral temperature is 6500K. Using this value will not change the
       color temperature of the display. Setting the color  temperature  to  a
       value  higher than this results in more blue light, and setting a lower
       value will result in more red light.

       Default temperature values:

              Daytime: 6500K, night: 4500K

[1mCONFIGURATION FILE[0m
       A configuration file with the  name  [4mredshift.conf[24m  can  optionally  be
       placed in [4m~/.config/[24m. The file has standard INI format. General program
       options are placed under the [1mredshift [22mheader, while options  for  loca‚Äê
       tion  providers  and  adjustment methods are placed under a header with
       the name of that provider or method. General options are:

       An example configuration file with the same effect as the above command
       line:

[1mHOOKS[0m
       Executables  (e.g.  scripts)  placed in folder [4m~/.config/redshift/hooks[0m
       will be run when a certain event happens. The first  parameter  to  the
       script  indicates  the  event  and further parameters may indicate more
       details about the event. The event [1mperiod-changed [22mis indicated when the
       period  changes  ([1mnight[22m,  [1mdaytime[22m, [1mtransition[22m). The second parameter is
       the old period and the third is the new period. The event is also  sig‚Äê
       naled when Redshift starts up with the old period set to [1mnone[22m. Any dot‚Äê
       files in the folder are skipped.

       A simple script to handle these events can be written like this:

              #!/bin/sh
              case [1m$1 [22min
                  [1mperiod-changed[22m)
                      exec notify-send "Redshift" "Period changed to [1m$3[22m"
              esac
